<font face="Arial" size="2">In 2006 Jonathan traveled to Kolkata, India in 
search of understanding the concepts of Indian Classical Raga music.&nbsp; It was at 
this time that Jonathan was initiated into the traditional Guru-Shishya 
Parampara training under Guru Pandit Shantanu Bhattacharyya, one of India’s 
premier Classical vocalists.&nbsp; In 2009, he returned to India understanding of the 
importance of immersing himself in the tradition and lifestyle of Hindusthani 
Raga Music.&nbsp; By sincerely devoting himself to intensive riyaz (practice) and 
focusing on the spiritual nature of Raga music the subtle nuances of each Raga 
began to express themselves through his western soprano and tenor saxophones, as 
well bansuri and dilruba. In his pursuit of Nada Brahma and the study of Raga 
Consciousness, Jonathan is exploring higher ideals of creativity and expression 
and its purest application to his western musically.&nbsp; His dedicated Sadhana has 
already helped him emerge as an innovative contributor to the evolution of Raga 
music performance.&nbsp; It is his rendering of Ragas in their entirety on saxophone, 
in both the vocal and instrumental styles, that has innovated saxophone 
techniques and created a style of playing the saxophone hitherto un-attempted.&nbsp; 
His research and development have produced the first non-tempered saxophone 
designed to more accurately express the subtle shruti’s (mirco-tones) of the 
Ragas.</font></p>
