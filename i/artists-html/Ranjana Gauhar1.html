<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Inspired by 
his vision and his sensitivity to portray “the complete woman” as one who 
personifies love, courage and substance, the eminent Odissi exponent Ranjana 
Gauhar, pays homage to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore through her presentation of 
his dance drama Chitrangada.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“Chitrangada” 
is timeless.&nbsp; It is as relevant today as it was when Gurudev visualized her.&nbsp; 
Ranjana has gathered her thoughts both from “Chitra”, the one-act play in 
English and “Chitrangada”, the popular Bengali dance drama both written by 
Rabindranath Tagore and found that the true essence of a woman lies beyond her 
external beauty.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">

<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Through her 
dance production, Ranjana, recounts the tale of Chitrangada, a Manipuri 
princess, who through her passion for Arjuna the great warrior from the epic 
Mahabharata, came to realize that her true power and potential as a woman lay in 
her duty towards society.</font></span></p>

Chitrangada as presented in the dance drama</font></span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Princess 
Chitrangada, a brilliant and brave character mentioned in the great Indian epic 
Mahabharata, was a warrior princess of Manipur, who fell in love with Arjuna, 
whose prowess in archery is well-known.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Inspired by 
her persona, Rabindranath Tagore, the great Indian litterateur, poet and Nobel 
recipient, embellished the character of Chitrangada with the myriad emotions of 
a woman. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In the year 
1892, Tagore gave a new dimension to the story of Chitrangada and set it in a 
dance drama, which turned out to be one of his most popular dance-drama. </font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The story 
goes that the brave Arjuna during his period of exile took to the hills for 
meditation. The territory came under the kingdom of Chitrangada, the warrior 
princess of Manipur. On one of her hunting forays she came across Arjuna. </font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">For one who 
has never known a life other than the battle field and defending her kingdom, 
Chitrangada is transfixed by the attractive Arjuna and despite herself falls in 
love with him. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Chitrangada 
asks him to disclose his identity and when she comes to know that it is the 
mighty Arjuna, she is in awe and determined to win his love.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">When the 
innocent Chitrangada expresses her feelings to Arjuna he rejects her under the 
pretext of celibacy. A spurned Chitrangada is shattered, hurt and insulted. She 
realizes that there is more to her personality than just being a warrior. The 
dormant emotions of love surfaces and like a determined and undefeated warrior 
she seeks the blessings of Lord Madana, the God of Love, to grant her ‘beauty’ 
for one year, the weapon with which she aims to subjugate Arjuna. </font></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A transformed 
beautiful Chitrangada by design starts living in the forest temple close to the 
place where Arjuna meditated and charms him. Arjuna is besotted by her beauty 
and consequently breaks his vow of celibacy. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">As days pass 
by she is suffocated under the burden of borrowed beauty. She undergoes an 
upheaval of emotions. Though it is true that she desires Arjun, but she desires 
him as an equal and without the trappings of beauty on lease.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Chitrangada 
returns to Madana and beseeches him to release her from this life of duplicity. 
The God of Love pacifies her misgivings and cajoles her to enjoy this phase of 
life as it a gift with a limited period. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">As the 
initial wave of love subsides, Chitrangada as well as Arjuna start to 
introspect. They learn of their true moorings as individuals and their calling 
in life. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Incidentally, 
one day Arjuna sees villagers fleeing and asks them the reason for the panic. He 
is told that the village has been attacked by dacoits and there is no one to 
fight and protect them. They lamented that their princess Chitrangada, who loved 
them like a mother and who fought like a tigress to protect them and defend the 
kingdom has gone on a pilgrimage to an unknown destination.&nbsp; The people’s love 
and admiration for Chitrangada ignites an interest in Arjuna’s mind about the 
brave princess and his desire to meet her gathers strength.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">An intrigued 
Arjun share’s his thoughts with the beautiful Chitrangada, who dissuades him by 
telling him that the warrior princess does not have attractive eyes like her nor 
a complexion as fair as hers. To this observation, Arjuna says that had she been 
there he would have fought the marauders along with the warrior princess. This 
becomes a moment of realization for Chitrangada, about her true strength, her 
duty towards her people and kingdom and her desire to shed the mask of 
falsehood. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Chitrangada, 
gets release from a make believe life, retrieves her dignity and returns to her 
kingdom. Arjuna comes to meet Chitrangada in her court and seeks her hand in 
marriage. Though she wants Arjuna as her companion, yet she asserts her right to 
be his equal in all respects and accept her for who she is. Arjuna accepts her 
on her own terms.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Rabindranath 
Tagore envisions “Chitrangada” like any other woman, who would desire to be an 
equal consort to the man of her choice while retaining her true identity. 
Chitrangada therefore becomes the exemplary woman. The musical dance drama is a 
lyrical portrayal of emotions in a woman, her dignity, individuality and 
worthiness that is as relevant in today’s life as it was eons ago.</font></span></p>
