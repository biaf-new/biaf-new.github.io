fifth generation in the family if traditional performers who have significantly 
contributed in the evolution and development of this art form. Shashadhar 
Acharya, is steeped in the tradition of Seraikella Chhau. He has inherited the 
knowledge of this art in legacy from his father, Guru Lingaraj Acharya. A quest 
to know and a desire to learn the differing perspectives of Seraikella Chhau 
from masters representing various schools within the tradition led him through a 
journey of intensive study. The great teachers besides his father Guru Lingoraj 
Acharya that he trained with include Guru Natshekhar B.B. pattanaik, Padmashri 
S.N. Singh Deo, Guru Kedar Nath Sahoo and Guru Bikram Kumbhakar.</span></font></p>

enabled him to communicate, through his dance the inherent spirit of Seraikella 
Chhau. Though he is creative in his methods of presentation he always aspires to

An Introduction</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singhbhum - an area that finds reference 
in the Puranas as a part of the ancient region of Utkal is now in eastern India. 
Seraikella, from where the unique maksed dance form of Seraikella Chhau 
originates is a part of this region. An energetic and spirited dance, this 
evolved from martial art techniques that were earlier practiced in this region 
by soldiers in the royal army. The etymology of the word chhau, itself explains 
the nature of this art form. This word traces its origin to the Sanskrit word 
Chhaya which means shadow. The thematic contents of the compositions arc mostly 
abstract and are steeped in symbolism.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parikhanda, a system of exercises 
practiced by the soldiers became more stylized, both in their physical and 
aesthetic sensibilities. Pharikhanda literally means shield and sword and till 
the present day the basic techniques are practiced holding a sword and shield. 
Chhau is different from other Indian classical dance forms primarily in its 
treatment of space and in its method of communication emotions. The dancer 
executes movements that thrust the body upwards away from gravity: spiral turns 
executed in the air, jumps and extended leg movements carry the dancer through 
choreographic patterns that traverse the performing space.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second unique feature of Seraikella 
Chhau is the complete absence of Vachikabhinya by means of vocal support and 
Mukhabhinaya, as the face is completely concealed by the mask. Thus the emoting 
is done kinesthetically through body movements. Mukhota or masks are an integral 
part of this dance style and the art of mask making is itself highly evolved. 
There are traditional families that specialize in this art, work together with 
choreographers and dancers add only after detailed study of the characters 
create the masks. A mask depicts only the essence of a particular character but 
in combination with the movements of the dancer the mask becomes extremely 
animated. Every move of the body, the tilt of the face imparts to the mask a 
whole range of expressions. When worn, the masks lead the dancer through a 
series of meditative experiences. Breathing through the masks there is a total 
negation of the self and a complete transformation into the character depicted. 
This overwhelming feeling makes it an extraordinary experience for both the 
dancer and the spectator.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The themes of the compositions are 
inspired from nature, mythology and even history. The rhythmic accompaniment is 
provided by traditional drums like Nagada, a huge kettle drum and Dhol, a 
cylindrical drum. The melody is provided by the Shehnai, reed pipes and bansuri, 
a bamboo flute. The compositions are classical, based on ragas that enhance the 
mood of the character. Contributions from the rulers of Seraikella, greatly 
helped in the evolution of Chhau and transformed it in to a sophisticated 
theatre art-form. In the present day, even though it is performed all over the 
world and highly regarded by both the fields if theatre and dance, Seraikella 
Chhau is intimately associated with the culture of this region. Every year in 
the spring people of Seraikella celebrate the Chaitra-Parva and through dance 
evoke the blessings of Kali, the mother goddess and Ardhnarishwar, a 
manifestation of Lord Shiva representing the male-female duality inherent in 
nature.</font></p>
