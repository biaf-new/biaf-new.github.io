<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Manasi Prasad is one of the best-known young Carnatic musicians, and combines 
years of traditional training with a modern outlook. She is also a trained 
classical dancer and an engineering and MBA graduate from IIM Bangalore, where 
she won the prestigious Aditya Birla Scholarship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Manasi chose her passion for 
music over the lure of a corporate career. Along with her year-round performance 
schedule in India and other parts of the world, Manasi’s activities include 
recording and composing music for her albums, writing and speaking on the arts, 
creating new productions and hosting various television shows. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She is also the 
head of an ambitious arts project – the Centre for Indian Music Experience-which 
will be India’s first interactive music museum. As a performing artist for over 
15 years now, Manasi has travelled extensively in her career, across India and 
the world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She is an empanelled artist of the ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural 
Relations), and has performed concerts at important concert venues in India and 
also in the US, Singapore, Middle East, Australia and Africa. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Numerous awards 
have come her way, including the prestigious Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar from 
Government of India’s Sangeet Natak Akademi, the Rotary-Brigade Young Achievers’ 
Award and the TEDIndia Fellowship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Manasi’s gurus in music include her mother- 
Tara Prasad and Ganakalabhushana R. K. Padmanabha in Bangalore. She has also 
trained in Chennai with Dr. Sriram Parasuram and Sangita Kala Acharya V. 
Subramanyam. Manasi has gained popularity as an innovative artiste, who never 
shies away from trying something new.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;In her Carnatic concerts, she is adept at 
rendering Raaga Taana Pallavis, especially the Avadhana Pallavi, which requires 
unique multi-tasking abilities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She regularly sings Carnatic-Hindustani Jugal 
Bandhis with popular Hindustani artistes. She used her dual abilities of singing 
and dancing to much acclaim, when she presented Giridhara Mira, a solo 
music-dance feature. She has also attempted to add a new dimension to classical 
music through her production- Olave Jeevana Saakshaatkara (Love is Life’s 
Fulfilment) – which explores the different facets of love. Recently, she 
conceptualized and presented Gana Yatra, featuring spiritual music forms from 
across India, with a 15 member ensemble. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Manasi has also attempted collaborative 
fusion work through her Carnatic lounge concerts, which have been performed on 
television and at corporate and conference gatherings.</font></p>
