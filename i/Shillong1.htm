<span style="line-height: 150%">Shillong 
Chamber Choir was formed in 2001 by Mr. Neil Nongkynrih. Initially, the idea 
started because the latter felt a need to hone some of the musical talents in 
Meghalaya and the North East. As the years progressed, the concept of the choir 
has now gone beyond just the musical aspect into a holistic approach.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="line-height: 150%"> In 2010, 
  they won the trophy for the reality television show ‘India’s Got Talent – Season 
  2’ and performed for US President Barak Obama at the Presidential Banquet, New 
  Delhi. Prior to this, in the same year they came back from the World Choir Games 
  in Shaoxing, China with Gold Diplomas in all the three categories in which they 
  participated – Musica Sacra, Gospel and Popular.</span></font></p>

  debut performance with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra with performances in 
  Shillong and Kolkata. In this season, the choir was keen to explore music from 
  Indian Cinema especially melodies of yester years rearranged by Mr. Nongkynrih. 
  In their repertoire, they have also sung an eclectic range of music from all 
  genres whether it is western classical, pop, jazz, gospel or musica sacra.</span></font></p>

  were first invited to The Rashtrapati Bhavan by the then President of India Shri

  years by Smt. Pratibha Patil for the annual Christmas concerts. Outside home the 
  choir has toured the U.K., Poland, Switzerland, South Korea, China, Malaysia and
