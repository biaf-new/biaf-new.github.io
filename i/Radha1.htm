<font size="2">Thomas and Mahajan met quite by chance. Thomas was idly googling 
this and that when she came across a video of Mahajan’s. She decided to track 
him down since she liked his playing so much. </font></span></p>

a singer while still in her teens in a rock and roll band called Human Bondage, 
which was India’s most popular band in the late 70s. She soon developed a strong 
taste for jazz, which is her favourite kind of music. She also began combining 
the tonal complexities of jazz with the rhythmic nuances of Indian classical 
music.</font></span></p>
