<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Intense, extraordinary and luminous 
are the qualities that distinguish Malavika Sarukkai’s dancing. With her 
artistic mastery and technique she commands a presence on the world stage.&nbsp; She 
is acclaimed globally for her creative dance choreographies, which transport the 
viewer to the heart beat of dance, taking dance beyond specific geographies. As 
a passionate path breaking dancer from India, she has contributed a significant 
and large body of work.&nbsp; Her collaborative productions have synergized through 
dialogues with artists from different media – poets, musicians, painters, 
sculptors and contemporary writers.&nbsp; These interactions bring to her 
choreographic interpretations the incandescent beauty of the classical language 
and the energized articulation of a contemporary mind.&nbsp; Malavika Sarukkai’s work 
is celebrated by critics, connoisseurs and the general public. More recently 
Malavika Sarukkai brought out her first dance DVD entitled – ‘Vaahini – the 
Sacred and the Worldly’. </span></strong></font></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: super">
<font size="2">Sakthi Sakthimaan is an energized 
production which moves effortlessly from the spaces of the Sacred Divine to the 
spaces of collective and personal worship. It is a production which cerebrates 
as it celebrates. The dance narrative invokes, recreates and calls upon the 
energies -&nbsp; both auspicious and fearsome. In the process, space is dynamised 
with sound and silence - recounting the primeval clash between good and evil 
cosmic forces and the good&nbsp; emerging as the triumphant victor .&nbsp;The dancing body 
celebrates&nbsp; the worship of Siva in his iconic form and of Devi in her many armed 
iconic image. Worship is&nbsp; seen, as in the Indian context,&nbsp; both&nbsp; as a 
ritualistic offering and also as an intimate personal thanksgiving. This 
production contains two unique&nbsp;choreographies. Inspired by Varanasi&nbsp;one 
choreography the plurality of approach to Siva. The other, a riveting narrative 
piece draws inspiration from the plural traditions of India and is in praise of 
Devi&nbsp; as Mahishasuramardini. </font></span></p>
